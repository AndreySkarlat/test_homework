                        FAR CRY 4 is a first-person action game; you play as Ajay Ghale, born in the fictional Himalayan country of Kyrat but raised in the United States. Your mother's dying wish was to have her ashes spread back in Kyrat, but when you return to perform this
                        duty, you find yourself caught in the middle of a civil war being led by rebels who want to overthrow the charismatic but oppressive dictator, Pagan Min. This sequel to 2012's Far Cry 3 lets you explore a vast open world using
                        weapons and vehicles to evade soldiers and wild animals. You can lead the fight by yourself or with friends thanks to the game's drop-in/drop-out cooperative mode. Alternatively, you can also fight PvP (player versus player) in
                        a competitive multiplayer mode.
